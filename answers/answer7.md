# You are on a team of 3 people, and one of your teammates continuously lags behind in the number of completed tasks. How would you handle this?
Although I would be directly affected by my teammate's behavior, my teammate's performance is outside my purview, and needs to be addressed by management. There could be important, valid reasons why a given developer's work output falls behind that of other developers. (A sickness in the family, a mental health issue or insomnia all come to mind.) The affected teammate's privacy demands that I accept their behavior. Simply put, I would need to be flexible and patient enough to work with team members regardless of their work output. I would expect the manager to know the team's performance well enough to recognize and investigate performance issues.
