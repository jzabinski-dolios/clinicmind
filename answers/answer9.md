# What is your current compensation structure and how do you see yourself in the next 5 years?
As the founder of a one-man startup, I have no compensation structure, outside of the profits generated by my business. I am looking forward to abandoning this model, moving on to a developer position making $125,000-150,000 per year. I am happy and satisfied with a senior role in technology, and in five years, I expect to be doing that job (and not necessarily managing a team). The qualifications for a senior software developer are constantly changing: I expect to be learning new things five years from now, and always.
