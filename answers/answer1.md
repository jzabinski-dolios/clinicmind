# Which operating system(s) do you run at home?
  This is challenging to answer completely. For software development, I mostly run Windows at home. I run macOS on an old Macbook Pro when I need to run end-to-end testing for Safari. I run iOS on my ancient iPhone. I run PS4 system software on a PS4 when I would like to be entertained.
